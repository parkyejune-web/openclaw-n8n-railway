### Core (always deployed)

| Service | Source | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **OpenClaw** | This repo (Dockerfile) | AI gateway with setup wizard, Tailscale mesh, and 4-platform compute routing |

### Companion Services (optional — delete any you don't need)

| Service | Image | Purpose | Depends On |
|---|---|---|---|
| **n8n Primary** | `n8nio/n8n` | Workflow automation engine with AI agent nodes | Postgres, Redis |
| **n8n Worker** | `n8nio/n8n` | Background workflow execution (queue mode) | n8n Primary, Postgres, Redis |
| **Postgres** | `postgres-ssl:17` | Persistent storage for n8n, Postiz, and Temporal | -- |
| **Redis** | `redis:8.2.1` | Queue/cache backend for n8n and Postiz | -- |
| **Postiz** | `postiz-app` | Social media scheduling and automation | Postgres, Redis |
| **Temporal** | `temporalio/auto-setup` | Distributed workflow orchestration | Postgres |

### Also included

- Tailscale encrypted mesh networking (embedded in OpenClaw container)
- 39 skills, 3 CLI tools, and 500+ SaaS integrations (via Composio) out of the box
- OpenTelemetry tracing with Langfuse (LLM evals) and PostHog (product analytics)
- Cost-optimized defaults that reduce API spend by 90%+
- Browser-based setup wizard at `/setup` for onboarding

## Prerequisites

You need: Railway account (2 min), Tailscale auth key (3 min), one API key (already have). Total setup: under 10 minutes.

1. **Railway account** — [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. **Tailscale account** — [tailscale.com](https://tailscale.com) (free for personal use)
3. **Tailscale auth key** — Generate at [Tailscale Admin > Keys](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/keys)
   - Enable **Reusable** and **Ephemeral** (recommended)
   - Pre-approve the key to skip manual device approval
4. **LLM API key** — Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, OpenRouter, or another supported provider

## Quick Start

### 1. Deploy to Railway

Click the deploy button above, or:

1. Fork this repo to your GitHub account
2. Create a new project in Railway
3. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo" and pick your fork
4. Add a **Volume** mounted at `/data` (persists config and workspace across deploys)

### 2. Set Environment Variables

The template auto-generates secrets and wires all cross-service connections via Railway reference variables. You only need to fill in:

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `SETUP_PASSWORD` | Yes | Password to access the `/setup` wizard |
| `TAILSCALE_AUTHKEY` | Yes | Tailscale auth key (reusable + ephemeral) |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Recommended | Set here or enter during setup wizard |

Everything else is optional and pre-configured with sensible defaults. For the full list of OpenClaw environment variables, see [`.env.example`](.env.example).

### 3. Run Setup

Once deployed, open your Railway service URL and navigate to `/setup`. Enter the `SETUP_PASSWORD` you configured and follow the wizard:

1. Choose your model provider (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, etc.)
2. Enter your API key
3. Optionally configure Telegram, Discord, or Slack channels
4. Click "Run setup"

The wizard runs `openclaw onboard` non-interactively, applies cost-optimized defaults, copies 39 skills to your workspace, and starts the gateway.

### 4. Connect from Your Local Machine

With Tailscale installed on your Mac/PC, the Railway instance appears on your tailnet:

```bash
# Verify the instance is visible
tailscale status | grep openclaw

# The OpenClaw gateway is accessible at:
# https://openclaw-railway.<your-tailnet>.ts.net
```

Your local OpenClaw CLI can now connect to the remote gateway over Tailscale.

## Removing Optional Services

After deploying, you can delete any companion services you don't need from the Railway dashboard. This reduces cost and simplifies your project.

| Service | Safe to Delete? | Impact if Deleted |
|---|---|---|
| **OpenClaw** | No | Core service — everything depends on it |
| **n8n Primary** | Yes | No workflow automation. Also delete Worker. |
| **n8n Worker** | Yes | Primary handles all execution (slower but functional) |
| **Postgres** | Only if n8n, Postiz, and Temporal are also deleted | Required by n8n, Postiz, and Temporal |
| **Redis** | Only if n8n and Postiz are also deleted | Required by n8n queue mode and Postiz |
| **Postiz** | Yes | No social media scheduling |
| **Temporal** | Yes | No distributed workflow orchestration. Postiz v2.12+ falls back to BullMQ. |

**Common configurations:**

- **OpenClaw only** — Delete n8n Primary, n8n Worker, Postgres, Redis, Postiz, Temporal
- **OpenClaw + n8n** — Delete Postiz, Temporal
- **Full stack** — Keep everything

## Architecture

### Request Flow

```
Internet → Railway :8080 → Express (server.js)
                              │
                    ┌─────────┴─────────┐
                    │                   │
              /setup/* routes      All other routes
              (setup wizard)       (proxy to gateway)
                    │                   │
                    ▼                   ▼
               Setup UI           Gateway :18789
              (browser)          (OpenClaw core)
                                       │
                              ┌────────┼────────┐
                              │        │        │

                           (API)   (tools)  (webhooks)
```

**How it works:**
- Express listens on port 8080 (Railway's public domain)
- `/setup/*` routes serve the setup wizard UI and API (protected by `SETUP_PASSWORD`)
- `/healthz` and `/setup/healthz` are unauthenticated health checks for Railway probes
- All other routes are proxied via `http-proxy` to the OpenClaw gateway on `127.0.0.1:18789`
- The gateway is a child process spawned by Express after setup completes
- The gateway only binds to loopback — it is never directly exposed to the internet
- If the gateway is not running, Express returns a 503 with troubleshooting hints

### Services

All Railway services below are deployed by the template and wired together automatically via [reference variables](https://docs.railway.com/variables#reference-variables). The multi-service template is defined in the Railway dashboard (not in `railway.toml`, which only configures the OpenClaw service's build/deploy settings).

| Service | Type | Role | Optional? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **OpenClaw** | GitHub repo (this repo) | AI assistant gateway with setup wizard, proxied through Express | No |
| **n8n Primary** | Docker image | Workflow automation engine with AI agent nodes | Yes |
| **n8n Worker** | Docker image | Background workflow execution in queue mode | Yes |
| **Postgres** | Docker image | Persistent storage for n8n, Postiz, and Temporal | If n8n/Postiz deleted |
| **Redis** | Docker image | Queue/cache backend for n8n and Postiz | If n8n/Postiz deleted |
| **Postiz** | Docker image | Social media scheduling ([postiz.com](https://postiz.com)) | Yes |
| **Temporal** | Docker image | Distributed workflow orchestration | Yes |
| **Tailscale** | Embedded | Encrypted mesh networking (runs inside OpenClaw container) | -- |
| **Modal** | External API | Serverless GPU/compute for ML inference, batch processing | -- |
| **Composio** | External API | Universal MCP server for 500+ SaaS integrations | -- |

### How OpenClaw Connects to n8n

The template auto-wires OpenClaw and n8n via Railway reference variables:

- `OPENCLAW_HOOKS_TOKEN` — auto-generated shared secret, injected into both services
- `N8N_WEBHOOK_URL` — set to `http://${{n8n Primary.RAILWAY_PRIVATE_DOMAIN}}:5678` on OpenClaw

**n8n triggering OpenClaw** (run AI from a workflow):
```bash
# n8n HTTP Request node calls OpenClaw's hooks API
POST http://OpenClaw.railway.internal:8080/hooks/agent
Authorization: Bearer <OPENCLAW_HOOKS_TOKEN>
Content-Type: application/json

{"message": "Summarize today's sales data", "deliver": true, "channel": "slack"}
```

**OpenClaw triggering n8n** (AI kicks off a workflow):
```bash
# OpenClaw cron or tool calls n8n's webhook trigger
POST http://n8n-Primary.railway.internal:5678/webhook/my-workflow
Content-Type: application/json

{"data": "process this"}
```

No manual setup required — the template handles all secret sharing and internal URL wiring.

### Manual n8n Webhook Wiring (Non-Template Deployments)

If you deployed manually (not using the one-click template), you need to wire OpenClaw and n8n together yourself:

**1. Generate a shared secret:**
```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
# Example output: a1b2c3d4e5f6...
```

**2. Set variables on the OpenClaw service:**

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `N8N_WEBHOOK_URL` | `http://n8n-Primary.railway.internal:5678` |
| `OPENCLAW_HOOKS_TOKEN` | `<paste the secret from step 1>` |

**3. Set variables on the n8n Primary service:**

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `OPENCLAW_HOOKS_TOKEN` | `<same secret as step 1>` |
| `DB_TYPE` | `postgresdb` |
| `DB_POSTGRESDB_HOST` | `Postgres.railway.internal` |
| `DB_POSTGRESDB_PORT` | `5432` |
| `DB_POSTGRESDB_USER` | `postgres` |
| `DB_POSTGRESDB_DATABASE` | `railway` |
| `DB_POSTGRESDB_PASSWORD` | `<from Postgres service variables>` |

> **Note:** n8n auto-creates all database tables on first successful connection. If you see "relation does not exist" errors, check the database variables and redeploy n8n.

**4. Redeploy both services** (n8n first, then OpenClaw).

**5. Test connectivity:**
```bash
# From n8n → OpenClaw (use n8n HTTP Request node):
POST http://openclaw-railway-template.railway.internal:8080/hooks/agent
Authorization: Bearer <OPENCLAW_HOOKS_TOKEN>
Content-Type: application/json
{"message": "test"}
# Should return 200

# Verify OpenClaw → n8n URL resolves:
# Check OpenClaw logs for: [hooks] n8n webhook URL configured
```

## Infrastructure Routing

The template routes workloads across 4 compute platforms automatically. See `workspace/AGENTS.md` for the full decision tree.

| Platform | Best For | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| **Railway** (this container) | Gateway, web server, cron, lightweight CLI tasks | ~$5-20/mo fixed |
| **Modal** (serverless) | ML inference, batch processing, image/video gen, data pipelines | Pay-per-second |
| **n8n** (orchestration) | Multi-step workflows, scheduled jobs, webhook chains | Included in Railway plan |
| **Composio** (SaaS bridge) | Direct SaaS actions (send email, create issue, update CRM) | Free tier available |

### Routing Examples

```
"Fix the auth bug in middleware.ts"   → Railway local + Claude Opus 4.6
"Generate 100 product thumbnails"     → Modal A10G GPU + Qwen 3.5 VL
"Every morning, email a sales report" → n8n scheduled workflow
"Post a message to Slack"             → Composio Rube MCP
```

You can add more skills by placing `SKILL.md` files in your workspace's `skills/` directory.

## Observability

The template ships with built-in OpenTelemetry instrumentation. All tracing is opt-in and gracefully degrades — no keys means no overhead.

### What Gets Traced

| Layer | Auto-instrumented |
|---|---|
| **Express routes** | All `/setup/*`, `/healthz`, proxy requests |
| **HTTP client** | Gateway proxy calls, n8n webhook calls |
| **LLM providers** | OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Cohere SDK calls (via OpenLLMetry) |

### Trace Backends

| Backend | Purpose | Required Vars |
|---|---|---|
| **Langfuse** | LLM tracing, evals, cost tracking | `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY` + `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY` |
| **PostHog** | Product analytics (setup, gateway events) | `POSTHOG_API_KEY` |
| **OTLP** (Grafana, Jaeger, etc.) | Generic APM traces | `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` |

PostHog events include OTel trace IDs for cross-system correlation. See `workspace/AGENTS.md` for the full observability architecture.

## Cost Optimization (Applied Automatically)

Running OpenClaw 24/7 on Railway can burn through API credits fast. This template applies cost-optimized defaults on first setup that can **reduce spend by 90%+**:

### What's Auto-Configured

| Setting | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Heartbeat model** | *matched to your auth provider* | Background checks run every 30min — uses the cheapest model compatible with your provider |
| **Active hours** | 06:00-23:00 UTC | Skip heartbeats while nobody's awake |
| **Context pruning** | `cache-ttl` with 6h TTL | Automatically prune old context, keep cache valid, reduce token bloat |
| **Memory compaction** | Flush at 40k tokens | Distill sessions into daily memory files instead of growing context forever |
| **Embeddings** | `text-embedding-3-small` | Cheapest OpenAI embedding model for memory search |
| **Coding subagents** | *matched to your auth provider* | Auto-selects a capable coding model compatible with your configured auth |
| **Concurrency limits** | 4 agents, 8 subagents max | Prevent cascading retries and runaway token consumption |

### Brain + Muscle Pattern

Use an expensive model as the "brain" (orchestrator) and cheaper models as "muscles" (workers):

| Role | OpenRouter Default | Why | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Brain** (orchestration) | `minimax/minimax-m2.5` | 196K context, $0.29/M in — cheap enough to never rate-limit, strong at task delegation | $ |
| **Coding muscle** | `anthropic/claude-opus-4.6` | Top-tier code generation, 1M context, deep reasoning | $$$ |
| **Heartbeat/cron** | `nvidia/nemotron-3-nano-30b-a3b:free` | Free-tier, 256K context, NVIDIA-backed reliability | Free |
| **Web search** | Brave API | | $ |
| **Social/trending** | xAI Grok API | | $ |

All three model roles are auto-selected based on your auth provider during setup. OpenRouter users get the best spread across cost tiers.

### Multi-Provider Auto-Registration

The setup wizard only configures one auth provider, but you can set **multiple API keys** in Railway variables. The template automatically detects and registers every available provider:

| Environment Variable | Provider Registered | Models Available |
|---|---|---|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | `anthropic` | Opus 4.6, Sonnet 4.6, Haiku 4.5 |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | `openai` | GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 Mini, GPT-4.1 Nano |
| `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` | `deepseek` | DeepSeek Chat (V3), DeepSeek Reasoner (R1) |
| `GROK_API_KEY` | `xai` | Grok 3, Grok 3 Mini |
| `KIMI_API_KEY` | `moonshot` | Kimi K2 |

When `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is detected alongside OpenRouter, coding subagents automatically route through Anthropic direct — giving you prompt caching, batch discounts, and Max subscription rate limits on the expensive coding work.

### Heartbeat Fallback Chain

Heartbeats use free-tier models via OpenRouter with automatic failover:

1. `nvidia/nemotron-3-nano-30b-a3b:free` (primary — NVIDIA, 256K context)
2. `stepfun/step-3.5-flash:free` (fallback — StepFun, 256K context)
3. `upstage/solar-pro-3:free` (fallback — Upstage, 128K context)
4. `arcee-ai/trinity-mini:free` (fallback — Arcee, 131K context)

### Further Savings

- Set model fallback chains in config so rate limits don't cascade to expensive retries
- Create a `HEARTBEAT.md` in your workspace — if it's empty, heartbeats are skipped entirely

## Managing Your Instance

### Setup Wizard

The `/setup` page provides:

- **Status** — Gateway health, version, links to the OpenClaw UI
- **Debug console** — Run safe diagnostic commands without SSH
- **Config editor** — Edit the full `openclaw.json` config with backup
- **Backup/restore** — Download and upload `.tar.gz` archives of `/data`
- **Device pairing** — Approve Telegram/Discord DM pairing requests

### Health Endpoints

| Endpoint | Auth | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/setup/healthz` | None | Railway deployment probe |
| `/healthz` | None | Detailed health (gateway reachable, config status) |
| `/setup/api/debug` | Basic | Full diagnostics (versions, paths, gateway state) |

### Updating OpenClaw

There are three ways to update OpenClaw, from heaviest to lightest:

**1. Docker rebuild** (full rebuild, ~10 min)

Redeploy from Railway to pull the latest OpenClaw `main` branch. Pin a specific version with the build arg:
```
OPENCLAW_GIT_REF=v2026.2.19
```

**2. Boot-time update** (no rebuild, updates on container start)

Set the `OPENCLAW_UPDATE_REF` environment variable in Railway. The container clones, builds, and starts the updated version automatically:

```bash
# Channel flags
OPENCLAW_UPDATE_REF=--stable    # Latest release tag (v*)
OPENCLAW_UPDATE_REF=--beta      # Latest pre-release tag (v*-beta*, v*-rc*)
OPENCLAW_UPDATE_REF=--canary    # Latest main branch commit

# Or pin to a specific ref
OPENCLAW_UPDATE_REF=v2026.3.1   # Specific tag
OPENCLAW_UPDATE_REF=main        # Branch
OPENCLAW_UPDATE_REF=fix/auth    # Feature branch
```

The update is stored on the `/data` volume. On subsequent restarts, the updated version is used automatically even without the env var set. Remove the env var after the first update to avoid re-building every boot.

**3. Live update from debug console** (no restart needed)

Open `/setup`, go to the Debug console, select `openclaw.update`, and enter a ref (`--stable`, `--beta`, `--canary`, or any branch/tag/SHA). The gateway restarts automatically with the new version — zero downtime.

Your config and workspace always persist on the `/data` volume. The original OpenClaw in the Docker image is never modified and serves as a fallback if an update fails.

### Safe service-only restart

To avoid accidentally touching companion services (`n8n`, `postgres`, `redis`, `temporal`), use:

```bash
scripts/safe-restart-openclaw.sh --yes
```

This helper verifies linked Railway context and only runs:

```bash
railway restart -s openclaw-railway-template -y

### One-command Mac connect (OpenClaw + Tailscale)

To configure your local Mac CLI against the Railway gateway and ensure Tailscale is on:

```bash
scripts/connect-mac-to-railway-gateway.sh
```

This script:
- Verifies `openclaw` and `tailscale` CLIs are installed
- Runs `tailscale up` when disconnected
- Fetches `gateway.auth.token` from Railway (if not provided)
- Sets `gateway.remote.url` + `gateway.remote.token` in local OpenClaw config
- Validates with a live `openclaw gateway call health --json`

Optional flags:

```bash
scripts/connect-mac-to-railway-gateway.sh --host openclaw-railway.<your-tailnet>.ts.net
scripts/connect-mac-to-railway-gateway.sh --token <gateway-token>
scripts/connect-mac-to-railway-gateway.sh --skip-token-fetch
```

## Troubleshooting

### Gateway not starting

**Symptoms:** `[proxy] Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:18789`, `[wrapper] gateway failed to start at boot`, or setup wizard loads but all proxied requests fail.

**Common causes:**

| Issue | Symptoms | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Missing API key | `[gateway] No model providers configured` | Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or another LLM key in Railway Variables |
| Invalid AWS credentials | `[bedrock-discovery] Failed to list models: SyntaxError` | Verify `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` |
| Gateway timeout | `Gateway did not become ready in time` | Increase `healthcheckTimeout` in `railway.toml` (default: 300s) |
| Insufficient memory | Gateway crashes silently | Upgrade to 2GB+ RAM in Railway plan. Check Metrics tab. |
| Corrupted state | Gateway crashes on startup loop | Delete `/data/.openclaw` and redeploy (workspace re-initializes) |
| Port conflict | `EADDRINUSE :18789` | Another process using the port — restart the service |

**Debug steps:**

1. Visit `/setup/api/debug` for full diagnostics (versions, paths, gateway state)
2. Open the Debug console at `/setup` and run `openclaw doctor`
3. Check Railway deployment logs for `[wrapper]` or `[gateway]` errors
4. Verify your API key is valid and has credits
5. Check memory usage in Railway Metrics — if consistently >90%, upgrade plan

### n8n "relation does not exist" errors

If you see `relation "public.execution_entity" does not exist` or similar errors in n8n logs, the database tables were never created. Common causes:

1. **`DB_POSTGRESDB_HOST` is misspelled** — double-check the variable name (not `HOSE`)
2. **`DB_POSTGRESDB_USER` is missing** — set it to `postgres` (Railway's default)
3. **n8n started before PostgreSQL was ready** — redeploy the n8n service

After fixing, redeploy n8n. It runs migrations automatically on startup.

### Gateway token missing (Control UI)

If the browser shows `unauthorized: gateway token missing`, you need to paste the gateway token into the Control UI settings. Find it at `/setup` on the Railway public URL (`https://<your-service>.up.railway.app/setup`).

### Tailscale not connecting

1. Verify `TAILSCALE_AUTHKEY` is set and not expired
2. Check if the key is pre-approved in Tailscale Admin
3. Look for `[tailscale] Connected to tailnet` in Railway logs
4. Ensure the auth key has not hit its usage limit

### 502 errors from Railway

This usually means the gateway hasn't started yet. The Express wrapper returns a `503` with troubleshooting hints. Common causes:
- Missing or invalid config (visit `/setup` to run onboarding)
- Gateway crash on startup (check `/setup/api/debug`)
- Volume not mounted (config lost between deploys)

### Telegram/Discord "pairing required"

1. Visit `/setup` and expand the "Pairing helper" section
2. Click "Refresh pending devices" to see requests
3. Approve the device ID for your chat

### n8n can't connect to OpenClaw

**Symptoms:** n8n HTTP Request node returns 502/503, or `[proxy] Error: connect ECONNREFUSED` in OpenClaw logs.

1. Verify `N8N_WEBHOOK_URL` is set on OpenClaw (should be `http://Primary.railway.internal:5678`)
2. Verify `OPENCLAW_HOOKS_TOKEN` matches on both OpenClaw and n8n Primary
3. Confirm the OpenClaw gateway is running (check `/setup` status page)
4. Test internal connectivity: `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" http://openclaw-railway-template.railway.internal:8080/healthz`

### No traces appearing in Langfuse

1. Verify both `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY` and `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY` are set
2. Check Railway logs for `[otel] Langfuse span processor enabled`
3. If you see `[otel] No trace backends configured`, the keys are missing or empty
4. Verify `LANGFUSE_BASEURL` if using a self-hosted Langfuse instance

## Deployment Checklist

Use this checklist when deploying for the first time or troubleshooting a broken deployment.

### Pre-Deployment

- [ ] Railway account created at [railway.app](https://railway.app)
- [ ] Tailscale account created at [tailscale.com](https://tailscale.com)
- [ ] Tailscale auth key generated (Reusable + Ephemeral recommended)
- [ ] At least one LLM API key ready (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.)

### Deployment

- [ ] Clicked "Deploy on Railway" or deployed from GitHub fork
- [ ] Volume mounted at `/data` (persists config and workspace)
- [ ] `SETUP_PASSWORD` set in Railway Variables
- [ ] `TAILSCALE_AUTHKEY` set in Railway Variables
- [ ] `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or another LLM key set (can also enter during setup wizard)
- [ ] Build completed successfully (~5-10 min, OpenClaw compiles from source)
- [ ] All deployed services show "Online" in Railway dashboard

### Post-Deployment

- [ ] Opened Railway service URL → `/setup`
- [ ] Entered `SETUP_PASSWORD` and completed the setup wizard
- [ ] Gateway started (logs show `[wrapper] listening on :8080`)
- [ ] No `[proxy] Error: connect ECONNREFUSED` errors in logs
- [ ] Tested a simple request in the OpenClaw UI

### If Using Companion Services (n8n, Postiz, etc.)

- [ ] n8n Primary shows "Online" and logs show successful database migration
- [ ] Postgres is healthy (n8n auto-creates tables on first connection)
- [ ] Redis is healthy (required for n8n queue mode)
- [ ] `OPENCLAW_HOOKS_TOKEN` matches on both OpenClaw and n8n Primary
- [ ] `N8N_WEBHOOK_URL` resolves correctly (check OpenClaw logs)
- [ ] Tested n8n → OpenClaw webhook (HTTP Request node to `/hooks/agent`)

### Monitoring

- [ ] Railway Metrics tab shows healthy CPU/Memory usage
- [ ] `/setup/healthz` returns 200 OK
- [ ] `/healthz` returns detailed health status
- [ ] PostHog analytics configured (optional — set `POSTHOG_API_KEY`)
- [ ] Langfuse tracing configured (optional — set `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY` + `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY`)

## Security

- The `/setup` wizard is protected by `SETUP_PASSWORD` via HTTP Basic auth
- The OpenClaw gateway binds to `127.0.0.1` only (not exposed directly)
- All external access goes through the Express wrapper or Tailscale Serve
- Gateway tokens are auto-generated and persisted to the volume
- Secret values are redacted in debug console output
- Tar import validates paths to prevent directory traversal
- Tailscale provides end-to-end encrypted mesh networking (WireGuard)
- Observability data is sent only to backends you explicitly configure
